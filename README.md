# Scot's sample GitLab project

New line to push to GH.

This sample project shows how a project in GitLab looks for demonstration purposes. It contains issues, merge requests, and Markdown files in many branches. The content is named and filled with lorem ipsum.

This para is a sample edit. Just to see if the mirroring setup works.

You can look around to get an idea how to structure your project and, when done, you can safely delete this project.
